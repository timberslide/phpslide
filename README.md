# phpslide

This is a (very much work in progress) php client for Timberslide

The library is super limited. Currently it can only stream events into Timberslide.

## Usage

Take a look at `Dockerfile` to see what the dependencies are.

Take a look at `example.php` which should be self explanatory.
